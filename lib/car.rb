# when your program is being executed, at the point at which the #go method is invoked, the compiler will first look in the class to which the instance of car that we are calling the method on belongs. If it finds a #go method there, it will execute that method. If it doesn't find such a method there, it will move on to look in the parent class that this class inherits from.
